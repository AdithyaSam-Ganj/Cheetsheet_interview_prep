    "The Hypothesis: The test has a null hypothesis that the data has a unit root, which means it’s not stationary. The alternative hypothesis is that the data is stationary or trend-stationary.\n",

    "The Output: The ADF test gives you a test statistic, a p-value, and critical values at different significance levels (like 1% or 5%).\n",

    "Interpreting the p-value: A low p-value (less than your chosen significance level) means you reject the null hypothesis. In this case, that means the data is likely stationary.\n",
